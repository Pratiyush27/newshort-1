Newshort - News, short. Now one might say, that there are already a few apps who provide with shortened news, so what are we doing differently? Glad you asked, because we propose to change the way the news is obtained and served.

Traditionally, experts have to be hired in order to handpick some articles (because human work speed is limited) and then read them, and painstakingly summarize while taking enormous amounts of time. We, want to change this. 

In our project, we used NLP techniques to take the news data from an API, scrape the news from websites, and automate the process of summarizing them. And all of this, happens in a few seconds,  a whole lot faster than what human skills clould acheive. We also take user's preference of categories and serve those articles that interest him/her. To take feedback from user about his likes/dislikes, we decided to add a playful element to the feedback process. Swipe left to dislike, swipe right to like, just like Tinder. Happy news reading!

## Note
The client app is built using React Native and present in UI folder
